Categorization Deep Learning

Based on https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html

Uses data sets MNIST (hand written numerals) and FashionMNIST (images of items of clothing) to train a deep learning NN to categorize the images into different groups.

To run the learning loop, type

	python pytorch1.py
	
To visualize the progress in real time, in a seperate cmd window, type

	python pytorch_visualise.py

To visualise what images the model is mis-identifying, edit PTModel.py to have visualize_errors = True and then run pytorch1.py
